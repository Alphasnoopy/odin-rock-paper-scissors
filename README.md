# odin-rock-paper-scissors
In this project, I will be creating a rock-paper-scissors game for the Odin Project. 

Live version: https://alphasnoopy.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/

### Once completed, I will have demonstrated my ability to:
* Implement a Typewriter global function
  - https://unpkg.com/typewriter-effect@latest/dist/core.js
* Create and use dictionaries and objects
* Utilaize CSS pseudo-class
* Deploy async/await/promsise functions
* Use transition effects and flexbox

Side Note: 
* Rock Paper Scissors has been changed to Rock Paper Scissors Spock in reference to a 
game in Big Bang Theory that was initially created by Sam Kass
